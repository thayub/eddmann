abstract: Using Python and BeautifulSoup to create a processed list of links.

Whilst uploading the [weekly podcast](http://threedevsandamaybe.com/) I am required to produce a list of links we discussed about on the show.
This can get a little tiresome, visiting each link and finding a suitable title.
Along with this, using Markdown you are required to provide lists in a specific format.
I had been doing this manually for a couple of weeks and last night I thought, I am a developer, I should not be doing unnecessary work.

Below is a simple script I wrote in Python (3) that grabs the latest entry from your clipboard (a list of links) and then processes them into the specified format.
By default it creates a Markdown formatted list, but this can be changed at the command line, by supplying another Python-format compliant string.
It is required that the script has access to an environment with '[xerox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xerox/)' and '[beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4)' packages installed.

~~~ .python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys, requests, xerox
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from requests.exceptions import InvalidSchema, MissingSchema

template = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else '- [{title}]({url})'
links = []

for link in xerox.paste().split('\n'):
    try:
        url = link.strip()
        print(url, '... ' , end='')
        req = requests.get(url)
        res = BeautifulSoup(req.text)
        title = res.title.string.strip()
        links.append(template.format(title=title, url=req.url))
        print(title)
    except (InvalidSchema, MissingSchema) as exp:
        print('x')

xerox.copy('\n'.join(links))

For convenience of invocation I store this script in my '~/bin' directory with execute privileges, allowing me to not have to specify the Python interpretor.
