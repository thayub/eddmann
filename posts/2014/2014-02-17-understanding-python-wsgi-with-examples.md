Coming from a strongly PHP background, initially looking at the web-development landscape whilst delving into Python seemed a little confusing.
As Python was not developed for the web from an offset, a specification was accepted called [PEP 333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/) which standardised the required interface between Web servers and Python Web Frameworks/Applications.
Despite the additional complexity, the manner in which middle-ware applications can be integrated, along with the server choice add possibilities that I find hard to locate a comparable in PHP.

### Basic Example

Simply put a WSGI (Web Sever Gateway Interface) compliant application must supply a callable (function, class) which accepts a 'environ' dictionary and 'start_response' function.
For a familiar PHP comparison, you can think of the 'environ' dictionary as a combined '$_SERVER', '$_GET' and '$_POST', with extra processing required.
This callable is expected to invoke the 'start_response' function with the desired response-code/header-data, and then return a byte iterable with the response body.

~~~ .python
def app(environ, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/html')])
    return [b'Hello, world!']

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
        httpd = make_server('', 8080, app)
        print('Serving on port 8080...')
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('Goodbye.')
~~~

Using the single-threaded [WSGI reference](http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/wsgiref.html) implementation provided with Python is a great choice for experimenting with these lower-level concepts.
You will notice that as the example is written for Python 3 we must return an iterable (in this case a list) with declared 'byte' content inside.

### Post Example

Now that we are familiar with the basic structure of a WSGI compliant application we can now experiment with a more practical example.
Below we provide the client with a simple form which posts a supplied 'name' for the application to greet accordingly.

~~~ .python
import cgi

form = b'''
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello User!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form method="post">
            <label>Hello</label>
            <input type="text" name="name">
            <input type="submit" value="Go">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
'''

def app(environ, start_response):
    html = form

    if environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST':
        post_env = environ.copy()
        post_env['QUERY_STRING'] = ''
        post = cgi.FieldStorage(
            fp=environ['wsgi.input'],
            environ=post_env,
            keep_blank_values=True
        )
        html = b'Hello, ' + post['name'].value + '!'

    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/html')])
    return [html]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
        httpd = make_server('', 8080, app)
        print('Serving on port 8080...')
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('Goodbye.')
~~~

Although somewhat verbose we have been able to create a simple web application which handles supplied POST data using the CGI modules 'FieldStorage' class.
These are the very simplified building blocks used in popular frameworks such as [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/).
