abstract: Two alternative ways of implementing Merge sort using Scala.

In a previous [post](/posts/merge-sort-comparison-in-java-and-scala/) I made a rudimentary comparison of Java and Scala using the [Merge sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm as a case-study.
There I described a trival Scala implementation which did not take into consideration tail-recursion, resulting in an unavoidable stack-overflow when faced with a sufficiently sized list.
In this post I wish to describe two very different implementations that resolve this gleming omission.

### Tail-recursion

A method call can be categorised as tail-recursive if there is no action to undertake after the method returns, aside from returning its own value.
In such an example, a compiler rewrite (in-effect mimicking [Goto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto)) can replace the caller in-place for the callee without any side-effects.
As a result, no new stack frame is required (re-using the existing one) per recursive call, providing similar efficiency to a common iteration loop.

The 'merge' method which is the point of stack-overflow consideration in our example has been refactored below to instead use an accumulator parameter, now completing all required work before the next call.
The compiler is then able to parse these recursive method calls and run the described optimisation.
In this case the Scala compiler does not require that an annotation be present as it can deduce this requirement, however for clarity I have included it.

~~~ .scala
implicit def IntIntLessThan(x: Int, y: Int) = x < y

def mergeSort[T](xs: List[T])(implicit pred: (T, T) => Boolean): List[T] = {
    val m = xs.length / 2
    if (m == 0) xs
    else {
        @scala.annotation.tailrec
        def merge(ls: List[T], rs: List[T], acc: List[T] = List()): List[T] = (ls, rs) match {
            case (Nil, _) => acc ++ rs
            case (_, Nil) => acc ++ ls
            case (l :: ls1, r :: rs1) =>
                if (pred(l, r)) merge(ls1, rs, acc :+ l)
                else merge(ls, rs1, acc :+ r)
        }
        val (l, r) = xs splitAt m
        merge(mergeSort(l), mergeSort(r))
    }
}

println(mergeSort(List(4, 2, 1, 3)))
~~~

A small example-driven inclusion that I have also made is in the use of an implicit method to provide the less-than predicate.
Implicts are an extremely powerful feature that deserves its own post, simply put however, the compiler is able to 'implicitly' deduce that I wish to use this comparator method based on its type signature (Int, Int => Boolean).

### Streams

Another example which elimates the chance of a stack-overflow when calling the 'merge' method is with the use of [Streams](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream).
From the provided 'numbers' method you can gain a simple understanding that a Stream is basically a lazily evaluated sequence, that only does the work (the generator method) when it is required.
This property does not particularly help us in this case, as we are required to know the finite length of the list for the divide-step.
What we can take advantage of is the implicit conversion that occurs with the call #:: to a [ConsWrapper](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream$$ConsWrapper).
Calling this operator creates a new 'Cons' object via the application 'cons.apply[A](hd: A, tl -> Stream[A]): Cons[A]', and due to the second argument being 'call-by-name', it does not get evaluated at this time on the stack.
As all objects on the JVM are created on the much larger heap, we in essence are indirectly transferring this work.

~~~ .scala
def mergeSort[T](pred: (T, T) => Boolean)(xs: Stream[T]): Stream[T] = {
    val m = xs.length / 2
    if (m == 0) xs
    else {
        def merge(ls: Stream[T], rs: Stream[T]): Stream[T] = (ls, rs) match {
            case (Stream.Empty, _) => rs
            case (_, Stream.Empty) => ls
            case (l #:: ls1, r #:: rs1) =>
                if (pred(l, r)) l #:: merge(ls1, rs)
                else r #:: merge(ls, rs1)
        }
        val (l, r) = xs splitAt m
        merge(mergeSort(pred)(l), mergeSort(pred)(r))
    }
}

def numbers(remain: Int): Stream[Int] =
    if (remain == 0) Stream.Empty
    else Stream.cons(util.Random.nextInt(100), numbers(remain - 1))

println(mergeSort((x: Int, y: Int) => x < y)(numbers(4)).toList)
~~~

I should note however, although the above example is very cratfy in its attempt to elimate a stack-overflow, it does off-course move this issue over to the heap.
As a result it is recommended to use the first example (tail-recursive optimisations) and enjoy the ninja-esque skills of the second one.
