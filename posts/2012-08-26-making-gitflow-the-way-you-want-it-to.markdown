I have been a part-time Git user for alittle over a year now, before this I had dabbled with using [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) but never for anything too serious.
I say part-time as throughout the year I never fully got to grips with all the ideologies/tools provided to aid in my development lifecyle process - in particular branching.

Sure, I had attempted to get my head around the great documentation found on the offical [Git website](http://git-scm.com/), along with a boat load of screencasts, but putting this into practise just never happened.
Up until recently I had been very happy working in 'master' and maybe if i'm feeling alittle crazy adding a temporary branch for a feature I may be experimenting on.

### Gitflow to the rescue

This has all changed since I found Gitflow (alittle late to the party I know), In 2010 Vincent Driessen posted on his site ([A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)) about how he used Git for both personal and work development.
He discussed incorporating the use of the branch types listed below:

* Master
* Hotfix
* Release
* Develop
* Feature

On-top of this he released a set of [Git extensions](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow), to help speed up and ease the learning curb.
If you are a Homebrew user like myself, installing Gitflow is as easy as running:

{% highlight bash %}
$ brew install git-flow
{% endhighlight %}

And then to begin using Gitflow on an existing Git repository, followed by creating a new feature called 'test':

{% highlight bash %}
$ git flow init
$ git flow feature start test
{% endhighlight %}

Now there is no point in me repeating the concepts put forth in Vincent's well laid out blog post, or adding yet another simple tutorial to the mix.
Instead however, I will leave you with a list of resouces that I have found useful when learning this subject:
